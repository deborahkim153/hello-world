# hello-world
Introducing myself!

Hello! I'm Deborah, an elementary education graduate who is trying for a new career track through Free Coding Camp. I've always been interested in computers and websites, but never knew about this site until someone I know recommended this site for me. 

Why I want to code: Like I said before, I am trying to find a new career, but would love it if my future job combined both education, a field that I'm trained in and have a passion for, and also coding. My ideal workplace would be either in an educational or an edtech company, but who knows what the future will hold for me!
